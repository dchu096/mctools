## 🌟 Why this exists

Most MOTD generators dont support minimessage codes.  
I wanted something that treats **MiniMessage** as a first-class citizen 💎 — gradients, nested tags, and clean output — while still giving you the classic formats when you need them. So I built a simple, fast tool that speaks both worlds. ⚡

### 🚀 What makes this different
- 🎨 **MiniMessage-first**: full support for nested tags like `<gradient>`, `<bold>`, `<italic>`, `<underlined>`, `<obfuscated>`
- 🔀 **Hybrid outputs**: generate MiniMessage **and** legacy/Spigot/Bungee/ServerListPlus strings from the same input
- 👀 **Accurate preview**: see how your colors, styles, and gradients actually look before pasting into configs
- ✨ **Centering + two-line flow**: MOTDs that line up nicely without trial and error

> 📝 If your server/proxy/plugin doesn’t parse MiniMessage for MOTDs, just copy the legacy output. If it does, enjoy the cleaner MiniMessage syntax.
